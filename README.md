# Hi! I'm gitty! 
I hope you didn't mistake me for an actual project with thousands of commits. Sorry about that if you did. This projects is more of a proof of concept. Take a look at the python code! 
Gitty generates a random(normally distributed, thanks to numpy) range of commits per day. This is what makes my github heatmap look so awesome. jaja. 
Well, check out the code. I hope you find it interesting. And sorry again if you mistook this as a real project with thousands of commits. This is a real project, but its also kind of a joke at the same time.
